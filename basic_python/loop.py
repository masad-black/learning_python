# Q1: count the +ve number is the list

# numbers = [0.-1,-2,-3,-4,1,2,3,4,5,6,-9,-10]
# count = 0

# for num in numbers:
#     if num > 0:
#         count += 1

# print(f"So the total possitive number in the list is {count}")

# Q2: sum the even numbers

# num = int(input("Enter the number: \n"))
# even_sum = 0

# for i in range(num):
#     if i % 2 == 0:
#         even_sum += i
# print(f"total sum of even number is: {even_sum}")
        

# Q3: print the tabel but skip the fifth iteration

# table_num = 6

# for i in range(1, 11):
#     if i==5: continue
#     print(f"{table_num} x {i} = {table_num * i}")

# Q4: check if the list is unique

# heros_list = [ "toji", "goku", "naruto", "itachi", "itachi"]

# for item in heros_list:
#     if heros_list.count(item) > 1:
#         print(f"List is not unique, duplicate is found: {item}")
#         break
